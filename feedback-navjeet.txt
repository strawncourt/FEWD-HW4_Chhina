Navjeet, your JavaScript is looking really good.

Your Read More text is sliding down nicely, but the Read Less is just disappearing, without the nice little slideUp effect. You may have done this on purpose as a stylistic choice because the slideUp effect looks a little weird with the Read More link above it. But I'll go ahead and show you how to get it to slideUp too in case you aren't sure.

On line 19 and 20, you have: 
  $().slideUp("readmore");
  $(".readless, #show-this-on-click").hide();

So the slideUp() isn't doing anything because there isn't anything in the first parentheses. So you can change it to:
  $("#show-this-on-click").slideUp();       (similar to what you have on line 9)
If you try this out, it still doesn't do anything because in line 20, you are hiding the same #show-this-on-click. Well, it is technically working, but the text is being hidden so you can't see that it's also sliding. So, you can just remove the #show-this-on-click in line 20:
$("#show-this-on-click").slideUp();
$(".readless").hide();

Tada! And now it works!


The rest of your code looks good. And nice job with the console.logs to test stuff!
